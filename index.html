				<h3 class="major articlePadding"  >ABOUT</h3>

				<h3 style="font-size:2rem; color:#00a1a1">Not Just a Sport, but a Life Skill</h3>

				<p class="classes-p">
					We believe that swimming is a basic human action, something that a
					regrettable amount of people cannot do. It is a life skill that
					teaches perseverance, confidence, trains the body, and builds
					character. We are coaches that want to bring out the best in any
					student that we teach, knowing that each swimmer is unique,
					requiring innovative approaches to swimming.
				</p>
				<p class="classes-p">
					Between the two of us, we have taught swimming for 15 years, swam on
					teams for 12 years, and life-guarded for 10 years. We have taught
					over 2000 students over our careers, and feel confident that we can
					teach anyone to swim. We believe in constant self-improvement,
					learning new methods and styles of swimming and coaching so that we
					can be the best for our students.
				</p>
				<p class="classes-p">
					We are elite competitive swim instructors that do not waste time
					with aimless games and simple entertainment. Unlike most swim
					schools, everything that we do is geared towards getting our
					students to be water-safe and to swim properly. Our games, songs,
					and all other exercises have an educational purpose.
				</p>
				<p class="classes-p">
					The basic necessity for swimming is water safety. Drowning is a very
					real problem in the United States, evidenced by a National Safety
					Council statistic that 74% of drowning deaths for kids under 15
					occurred at a residential location (a pool). This issue should not
					be a factor in human society, and for this reason, we wish to teach
					as many students the love and respect for water.
				</p>
				<p class="classes-p">
					According to Psychology Today, 46% of ADULT Americans fear the deep
					end of the pool. As a child, being afraid can classes-p to panic and
					self-doubt, and avoiding even attempting to learn, which may reflect
					in future situations, such as Price and school. Building confidence
					through hard Price and rewarding struggle teaches children about
					their capabilities and builds self-worth. Finally, the health
					benefits of swimming are nearly limitless, training the lungs,
					heart, and the body, granting a lifetime of health benefits. For
					this reason we push students to set goals and then overcome them,
					improving their lives.

						Kevin is an amazing coach. Our daughter improved with his lessons
						instantly. He makes the sessions fun, but at the same time keeps
						her working hard. His explanations on what to do and how to fix
						mistakes are straight to the point, so improvement is instant...
						honestly, by just looking at him training my 7 year old daughter I
						picked up a few tips, and was able to significantly improve my
						brass stroke... amazing. Thought I was just quickly getting tired,
						turned out it is not the case after I adjusted my technique
						myself. Highly recommend!!!!

						Ki and Kevin are literally THE swim lesson guru’s. My 4 year old
						daughter was terrified of even going anywhere near the water and
						now she can’t wait to get in the pool. Their methods are second to
						none and more importantly the trust they built with her was more
						impressive than anything. 12/10 would recommend to anyone. These
						guys are the real deal.

						My 4 year old daughter started lessons with coach Kevin and coach
						Ki at end of May 2021 and she loves working with them. Their
						gentle approach to lessons has helped her feel comfortable and
						confident in the water. She has improved and is nearly water safe
						in just 4 lessons. I can’t wait to see how far she will advance
						over the next month of lessons. The coaches are very experienced,
						responsible and fun your child is in the best hands.
